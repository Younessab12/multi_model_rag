Introduction
============

Overview
--------

Multi-Model RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) App is an advanced question-answering system that retrieves and generates answers by combining vector-based search with large language models (LLMs). The app provides a seamless interface for exploring pre-stored context and generating detailed responses. It is built with:

- **LangChain**: Enables integration of large language models with retrieval chains.
- **Chroma**: Serves as a high-performance vector database for efficient similarity search and document retrieval.
- **Streamlit**: Powers the user-friendly, web-based interface for interacting with the system.

Features
--------

- **Efficient Retrieval**: Access contextually relevant information stored in a vector database.
- **Fallback Generation**: Generate responses using LLMs when the context lacks specific answers.
- **Interactive and Configurable**: A dynamic interface to customize queries and model configurations.

Components and Their Roles
--------------------------

1. **LangChain**:
   
   - Acts as the backbone of the retrieval-augmented generation process.
   - Facilitates the integration of LLMs for combining search results with language model capabilities.
   - Simplifies the development of chains that merge retrieval and answer generation.

2. **Chroma**:
   
   - A robust vector database that stores and indexes document embeddings.
   - Enables fast and accurate similarity searches for retrieving relevant content based on user queries.
   - Maintains persistence for efficient reuse of pre-processed data.

3. **Streamlit**:
   
   - Provides a lightweight and interactive web-based user interface.
   - Allows users to input queries, retrieve answers, and visualize results in real time.
   - Ensures ease of deployment and use, making the app accessible without complex setup.
